# Generate Password

# Overview 
    Using different if/else statements and functions, I created a webpage that will generate a password for the user based on a set criteria that it is given. The user is able to build a password between 8 and 128 characters with the option of using lowercase alphabet characters, uppercase alphabet characters, numbers and special characters.

    To generate the password, the page allows the user to click the 'generate password' button which leads them to muliple prompts to determine what they would like in their password. The prompts are created using different confirm and prompt tools from javascript. The password character count promote is then converted into a 'number', so that it can be used throughout the code to limit the length of the password. All the prompts are listed in the console log to be used a reference to confirm that page is reading all the selected options.
